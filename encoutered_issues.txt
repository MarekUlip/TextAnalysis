Tensorflow errors can sometimes be a bit confusing so here are a few tips if your training fails during some error or warning. Note that these are beginner advices so dont take these advices too seriously. <br/>
Try to turn off all other programs especially those that show videos or images. If not told tensorflow takes whole graphic cards space and if you dont have some GPU on processor it can cause tensorflow crash because of a conflict. <br>
Another problem might be that your network is just too large for your graphic card to process. Try reducing number of neurons. Specifically in text classification first layer usually has a lot of parameter due to fact that it has to take a vector of length equal to num of words that tokenizer recognizes. So even a Dense layer with 128 neurons that takes 10000 long vector will end up with about 1.2 million weights. <br>
Also training more than one network might cause issues. Memory should be usually cleared if network is not used anymore but I sometimes ran acrross out of memory issue on networks that ran ok when trained separately. <br>
Tensorflow versions can also make quite the difference. For example before 2.0 my notebook (GPU GeForce 960M) had a lot of problems to put some networks into memory or to train them properly. But with 2.0 those problems vanished. I also ran on different behaviour of model predict with generator - Up until 2.1 I saved labels when article was loaded in a batch and these labels matche perfectly when creating confusion matrix after predictions. But with 2.1 These labels got misteriously mixed that predictions didnt match their respective labels.
